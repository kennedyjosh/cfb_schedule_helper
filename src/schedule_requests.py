    The schedule request will come as one long string. Here are the formatting rules:
    1. Lines that start with a number indicate that the following lines are that team's requests.
        ex: 1. Clemson
    2. Requests must include, at minimum, the team name.
        ex: Rutgers
      Additionally, a home/away preference can be specified in parentheses after the team name.
        ex: Rutgers (Home)
      If the home/away preference is in brackets, this will override any home/away balancing to force the preference.
        ex: Rutgers [Home]
    3. A blank line separates one team from the next.
    4. All symbols (besides parentheses for home/away preference) will be ignored.

    This function will return one of two tuples:
      True, results
      False, errors
